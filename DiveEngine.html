								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									Dive engine is a project I started for the <a href="https://eecs498.com/">Game Engine Architecture Class</a> at the University of Michigan. We went through the process of creating
									first a game, and then slowly gutting it and adding functionality week by week until it became a full fledged 2D game engine. This engine 
									utilizes Lua and LuaBridge for scripting, SDL for 2D rendering as well as input, Box2D for the 2D physics and collision manager, GLM for math, and Rapidjson for parsing scene files.

								</p>

								<h2>Controller Support</h2>
								<p>
									After creating the engine I wanted to add new ways of interacting with my game engine. Something pretty simple to start was to add controller support
									using SDL. After getting it to work for one controller I added it for multiple controllers so that you can create a game where multiple players can play via controllers 
									at the same time. I also earlier noted that there was stick drift or a dead zone and I fixed that by limiting how small an input could be, it doesn't impact the overall movement feel
									however makes it so that there is no "stick drift" or dead zones where the player can't sit still after moving.

								<h2>CMake</h2>
								<p>
									After taking a break from dev for a week or two I wanted to make sure it was easier to add new libraries to my game engine. Having to struggle with linking
									SDL and other libraries on Mac, Linux, and Windows I was happy to spend a week on learning and integrating CMake so I won't have to spend countless hours
									trying to link other libraries. I still have a lot to learn about CMake, but for now I am happy to know CMake will build my game engine and I can add OpenGL
									and other libraries with relative ease!
								</p>

								<h2>Plans</h2>
								<p>
									After spending a half year on this project I am not ready to let this go. During the summer I plan to add UI elements like a scene editor and also a really big one
									I plan on doing is add in 3D support using OpenGL.
