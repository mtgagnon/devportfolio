								<h2> 5/22/24 </h2>
								<p> This is the first of hopefully many dev logs for my own benefit really, so I can keep track of what I did. I recently saw
									a youtube video about how organization and keeping oneself organized especially when coding will help save hours in debugging. So 
									that's what this is! I hope to use this a lot but and haven't decided if this is going to be a daily thing or if I will try and 
									do this more infrequently.
									<br><br>
									I took a good break from school and so this past week was my first week back to coding after graduation. This week I have integrated CMake! 
									This stemmed from my want to make Dive Engine also support a 3D graphics as my end of year project for my class. I ended up pivoting as I was 
									unable to get OpenGL and some supporting libraries integrated into my game engine. Because of the friction of adding libraries manually into 
									my project I was unable to pursue the project I wanted, it was super frustrating. So that's why I decided my first challenge was to learn CMake 
									and integrate it into my project. It took a little under a week and was a little overwhelming at first as most things are. I still feel like 
									there are some black box CMake files like the SDL2 cmake file, I can read and understand most of it, but there is just so much going on with
									that file that I have only touched a little bit. Hopefully as I add more libraries I will understand more about CMake, but for now I am really happy
									with having a good understanding of CMake so I can build and add libraries with ease to my project. This also really helps with porting my project, so if
									someone wants to use my engine all they need to do is create a build folder and run my CMake file and they will have a working build of my Game Engine!
									<br><br>
									And most importantly one of the big reasons I added CMake was so I can easily add OpenGL and helper libraries. This week I plan to do that and get some basic
									integration of OpenGL in my engine!
